# API Server Tutorial

This is the api raw list of `Zhihui` platform.

There are 3 types of accounts, and they are `member`, `classroom`, `teacher`.

We use `mongodb` to explore datas, and we use `actix` based on `Rust` to create apis.

In this folder, you can view all the api rawlist, and find, develop them. All
api requests and responses are followed by the description here.

Api rawlist file is edited by `yaml`, and you can visit it in `api` folder.
